# SageMaker-XGBoost-Predictor-
This project uses a simple bank dataset to train and test an XGBoost model. The entire process, including model deployment, is carried out on AWS SageMaker. Data and the trained model are stored in AWS S3 buckets, enabling seamless integration with SageMaker endpoints for easy deployment and inference.
